# Drawer menu animated

This is a very functional component using the functionality of the Gesture Handler to create a nice drawer navigator animated.

## üî® Project Functionality

It's a simple functionality - when clicking the menu button, instead of opening the drawer in the traditional way, it will open with an animated transition.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

- `Using React Native with Expo`: The expo makes setting up the environment easy;
- `Use the library GestureHandler`: This library provides an API that exposes mobile platform specific native capabilities of touch & gesture handling and recognition.
- `Using Expo Router`: is a file-based router for React Native and web applications. It allows you to manage navigation between screens in your app, allowing users to move seamlessly between different parts of your app's UI, using the same components on multiple platforms (Android, iOS, and web).

## üõ†Ô∏è Open and run the project

To install React Native with Expo on your OS, follow the steps in https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/ and https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/
##### After that, clone the repository and:
- run **npm install** or **yarn**
